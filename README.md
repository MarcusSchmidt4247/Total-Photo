### Introduction:

Photos can recall important moments in life, inspire creativity, and educate. They are also easily lost in a folder with hundreds of other photos. Unfortunately, categorizing the photos into dozens of separate folders disrupts the viewing experience when you want to see multiple events. Total Photo is a macOS desktop app that provides flexible tools to view the exact combination of photos you want across any number of folders.

### Project Framework:

wxWidgets and Visual Studio Code are used with C++ to create a GUI with cross-platform potential. git provides version control.

### Base Features:
- Dialog to choose root directory and open image viewer
- List of subdirectories to include in the sort
- List of file types to include in the sort
- Sort options (by date created, name, and random order)
- Keyboard controls for the image viewer (arrow keys to go forward or backward in the queue)
